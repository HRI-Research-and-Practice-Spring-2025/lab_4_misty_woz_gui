This repository contains the starter code for [Lab 3: Robot Programming 2 - Wizard-of-Oz GUI for Misty]([https://classes.cs.uchicago.edu/archive/2025/spring/20630-1/lab_03_hello_misty.html](https://classes.cs.uchicago.edu/archive/2025/spring/20630-1/lab_04_wizard_of_oz.html)) for the University of Chicago course [CMSC 20630/30630 Human-Robot Interaction: Research and Practice](https://classes.cs.uchicago.edu/archive/2025/spring/20630-1/index.html) taught by Dr. Sarah Sebo in Spring 2025. 

The learning goals for this lab are:
- Students will develop a Wizard-of-Oz (WoZ) GUI interface that enables a human experimenter to control Misty in real-time during a human-robot interaction.
- Students will expand Misty's expressive capabilities by creating GUI buttons for speech, gestures, LED changes, and other behaviors.
